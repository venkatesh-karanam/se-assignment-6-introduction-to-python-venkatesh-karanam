# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Some key features include:

Readability: Python's syntax is clear and easy to understand.
Versatility: It can be used for web development, data analysis, machine learning, scripting, automation, etc.
Large Standard Library: Provides modules and functions for various tasks.
Community Support: A large, active community that contributes to a wealth of resources and libraries.
Interpreted Language: Executes code line-by-line, which is great for debugging and interactive development.
Examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective:

Web development (e.g., using Django, Flask)
Data analysis and visualization (e.g., using Pandas, Matplotlib)
Machine learning (e.g., using TensorFlow, scikit-learn)
Scripting and automation
Scientific computing (e.g., using SciPy)

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

Installing python:

Windows:

Download the installer from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/).
Run the installer and check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".
Click "Install Now".
Verify the installation by opening Command Prompt and typing python --version.

Setting up a virtual environment:

Install virtualenv using pip: pip install virtualenv.
Create a virtual environment: virtualenv myenv.
Activate the virtual environment:
Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

   print("Hello, World!")

print: A built-in function that outputs text to the console.
"Hello, World!": A string, which is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

   Basic Data Types:

int: Integer, e.g., 42
float: Floating-point number, e.g., 3.14
str: String, e.g., "Hello"
bool: Boolean, e.g., True or False
list: Ordered, mutable collection, e.g., [1, 2, 3]
tuple: Ordered, immutable collection, e.g., (1, 2, 3)
dict: Unordered collection of key-value pairs, e.g., {"key": "value"}
Script:

python Copy code
# Integer
a = 42
print(a, type(a))

# Float
b = 3.14
print(b, type(b))

# String
c = "Hello"
print(c, type(c))

# Boolean
d = True
print(d, type(d))

# List
e = [1, 2, 3]
print(e, type(e))

# Tuple
f = (1, 2, 3)
print(f, type(f))

# Dictionary
g = {"key": "value"}
print(g, type(g))

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

Conditional Statements:
Used to execute code based on certain conditions.

python
Copy code
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
Loops:
Used to iterate over a sequence of elements.

For Loop:

python
Copy code
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
While Loop:

python
Copy code
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help to organize code, make it reusable, and improve readability.

python
Copy code
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result = add(3, 5)
print(result)


7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

   Lists:

Ordered collection of elements.
Elements are accessed by their index.
Elements can be of any data type.
Dictionaries:

Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
Elements are accessed by their key.
Keys are unique and immutable, values can be of any data type.
Script:

python
Copy code
# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers)

# Dictionary
student = {"name": "John", "age": 21, "course": "Computer Science"}
print(student)
student["age"] = 22
print(student)

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

   Exception handling is used to manage errors that occur during the execution of a program, allowing the program to continue running or gracefully exit.

python Copy code try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
finally:
    print("This will always execute")

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

   Modules:

A module is a file containing Python code (functions, variables, etc.).
Can be imported into other scripts to reuse the code.
Packages:

A package is a collection of modules in directories that provide a hierarchy.
Example:

python
Copy code
import math

# Using a function from the math module
result = math.sqrt(16)
print(result)

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

    Reading from a file:

python
Copy code
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing to a file:

python
Copy code
lines = ["Hello", "World", "This is a test"]

with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + "\n")
